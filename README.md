# On the estimation of population size – A comparison of capture-recapture and multiplier-benchmark methods

This directory contains the code to produce the simulation work for the thesis project "On the estimation of population size – A comparison of capture-recapture and multiplier-benchmark methods". It contains code to run the simulations comparing the capture-recapture approach to the multiplier-benchmark approach in multiple scenarios, including both the assumptions met and violated situations.
